- Designed and implemented a scalable metrics retrieval solution using Thanos and Prometheus.
- Addressed challenges of increasing metrics data volume by leveraging Thanos for horizontal scaling of metrics querying and delivery (Thanos Query).
- Conducted comparative analysis with traditional methods across performance, cost, network bandwidth utilization, and storage efficiency
- Evaluated additional metrics including time to scale and latency to assess feasibility and effectiveness of the solution.
